# Changelog

All relevant changes to this project will be documented here.

This project follows a conservative interpretation of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), with a focus on API stability
and explicit behavior.

## **0.1.0** (2025-12-20)

### Added
- **yastrider**: Initial public release.
  - Unicode-aware text normalization utilities.
  - Diacritic stripping via Unicode normalization forms (`NFC`, `NFD`, `NFKC`, `NFKD`).
  - Token-based preservation mechanism to protect selected characters or substrings during normalization.
  - Character removal utilities based on Unicode categories.
  - ASCII-safe string conversion, with:
    - Optional percent-encoding helper for non-ASCII character encoding.
  - Centralized regex compilation helper with caching and explicit flag control.
  - Regex-based text redaction with:
    - Case-insensitive support
    - Optional fixed-length masking
    - Safe literal escaping when regex is not assumed
  - Configurable text wrapping with:
    - Paragraph preservation
    - Optional whitespace normalization
    - Word-aware wrapping and hard-wrapping modes

### Design Notes
- No external runtime dependencies; *standard library only*.
- Explicit validation and defensive programming.
- Clear distinction between normalization, formatting, and redaction concerns.
- APIs are intentionally strict to avoid silent data corruption.
- Documentation emphasizes when *not* to use the library.

### Known Limitations
- Normalization operations are intentionally lossy by design.
- Not intended for NLP, linguistic analysis, or language-aware transformations.
- Paragraph detection is heuristic-based (blank-line separation).
